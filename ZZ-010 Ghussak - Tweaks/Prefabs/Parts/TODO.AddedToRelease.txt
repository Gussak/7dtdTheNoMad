- change underground hints smoke to have 60 airblocks (or other almost invisible blocks above it), the idea is to create a hole from where the smoke is coming out, to look good

- all traps: place 1 almost broken weak wooden spike, and one fully good of every other spike, total 4
- traps wasteland: remove the loose boards
- traps forest: remove the green loose boards
- traps snow: place corner blocks to hide the black earth below the white snow and remove the loose boards
















========================= DONE
DONE- traps desert: being the easiest biome, keep the loose boards. OK

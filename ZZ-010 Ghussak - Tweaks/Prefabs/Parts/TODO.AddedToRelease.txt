- change underground hints smoke to have 60 airblocks (or other almost invisible blocks above it), the idea is to create a hole from where the smoke is coming out, to try to look good at least. Using pole blocks but they are too visible. May be, placing just one tiny thing at 30m above will force all in-between to become air blocks?













========================= DONE
DONE- traps desert: being the easiest biome, keep the loose boards. OK

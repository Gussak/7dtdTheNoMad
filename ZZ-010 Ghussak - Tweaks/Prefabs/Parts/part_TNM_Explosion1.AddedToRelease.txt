#PREPARE_RELEASE:REVIEWED:OK

group IDs:
 10... zombdogs
 20... snakes (give better harvesting, so may spawn none or at most just a few. meant also to be a surprise after all they are sneaky snakes)
 30... zombvultures (top ones are mandatory)
 
All groups 'active' to awake them as soon as possible.

Obs.: unable to comment on xml as file will be replaced.

ISSUE: this fails as overlapping sleeper volumes wont trigger right?
All sleeper volumes shall trigger as soon the player enters on any.
To EDIT may be better use this:
  <property name="SleeperVolumeSize" value="11, 1, 5#11, 11, 5#11, 17, 5#11, 1, 5" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeStart" value="0, 1, 0#0, 4, 0#0, 21, 0#0, 0, 0" />
To RELEASE:
  <property name="SleeperVolumeSize" value="11, 39, 5#11, 39, 5#11, 39, 5#11, 39, 5" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeStart" value="0, 0, 0#0, 0, 0#0, 0, 0#0, 0, 0" />

ISSUE: only 'old outdoor light' works as point/omni? others even if configured like that the light wont go thru/behind/everywhere.

TODO: add something special to the bell. A new bell block that has some trigger may be?
TODO: add something special to the top black pearl. May be explode as fireworks?
TODO: release this prefab as a stand alone mod (needs to be configured to be auto placed by vanilla RWG)

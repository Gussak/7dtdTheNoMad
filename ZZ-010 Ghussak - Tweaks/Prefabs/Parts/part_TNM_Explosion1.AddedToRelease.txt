#PREPARE_RELEASE:REVIEWED:OK

group IDs:
 10... zombdogs
 20... snakes (give better harvesting, so may spawn none or at most just a few. meant also to be a surprise after all they are sneaky snakes)
 30... zombvultures (top ones are mandatory)
 
All groups 'active' to awake them as soon as possible.

Obs.: create this file because we are unable to place comments on xml (like help="...") as the file will be replaced.

ISSUE: this fails as overlapping sleeper volumes wont trigger right?
All sleeper volumes shall trigger as soon the player enters on any.
To EDIT may be better use this:
  <property name="SleeperVolumeSize" value="11, 1, 5#11, 11, 5#11, 17, 5#11, 1, 5" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeStart" value="0, 1, 0#0, 4, 0#0, 21, 0#0, 0, 0" />
To RELEASE:
  <property name="SleeperVolumeSize" value="11, 39, 5#11, 39, 5#11, 39, 5#11, 39, 5" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeStart" value="0, 0, 0#0, 0, 0#0, 0, 0#0, 0, 0" />

ISSUE: only 'old outdoor light' works as point/omni? others even if configured like that the light wont go thru/behind/everywhere.

TODO: add something special to the bell. A new bell block that has some trigger may be?
TODO: add something special to the top black pearl. May be explode as fireworks?
TODO: release this prefab as a stand alone mod (needs to be configured to be auto placed by vanilla RWG)

============ creating a new prefab: 
ISSUE: I am unable to use the editor properly (about sleeper volumes and also moving selections), so the only way is to edit the xml and reload the prefab :(. So, copy all sleeper properties from another xml file and paste minimal config on the new one. While in the editor, on the 2nd edit tab, there is a CopySleeperVolume that makes it easy to add a new one to edit in the xml later. Base xml ex.:
  <property name="SleeperVolumeSize" value="3, 2, 4" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeStart" value="0, 50, 0" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeGroupId" value="10" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeGroup" value="animalZombieDog,3,6" />
  <property name="SleeperIsLootVolume" value="True" />
  <property name="SleeperIsQuestExclude" value="False" />
  <property name="SleeperVolumeFlags" value="0" />

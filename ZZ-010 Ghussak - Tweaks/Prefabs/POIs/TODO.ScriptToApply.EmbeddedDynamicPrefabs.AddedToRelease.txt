The POIs prefabs can have embedded POIMarkerPartToSpawn PartSpawn.
But it would only apply when using the RWG from the game engine.
Changing prefabs.xml on the fly (after the game started), will not place the embedded prefabs relatively to the POIs absolute location and rotation.
A simple script can calc all that and place the missing embedded prefabs on the fly!

TODO: put ambush raiders on TNMTeam bridge to center tower
TODO: replace all snow blocks with something else, as it is just free water in the end, and it wont melt outside snowy biome
TODO: grant all shutters open to the outside to not block inside paths...
TODO: make some dents on underground TNMTeam tunnels
TODO: on fortress and mini towerfortress, leave a single hole to let player place stairs to go above the ceiling

DONE: put team smoke behind the mini fortress...
NO.ItIsGoodTheyStayThereInCover.TODO: open unlocked doors and hatchs so raiders become able to move thru them (they are not opening them, or fix the raiders if possible).
DONE: close the top of mini fortresses, raiders are probably jumping over the big chest there..
DONE: add destroyed: workbench, chemestry station, furnace, cement mixer, generator bank to  mini fortresses only. but add this set to middle toppest area too.

The POIs prefabs can have embedded POIMarkerPartToSpawn PartSpawn.
But it would only apply when using the RWG from the game engine.
Changing prefabs.xml on the fly (after the game started), will not place the embedded prefabs relatively to the POIs absolute location and rotation.
A simple script can calc all that and place the missing embedded prefabs on the fly!

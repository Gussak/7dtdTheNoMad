But it would only apply when using the RWG from the game engine.
Changing prefabs.xml on the fly (after the game started), will not place the embedded prefabs relatively to the POIs absolute location and rotation.
A simple script can calc all that and place the missing embedded prefabs on the fly!

TODO: open unlocked doors and hatchs so raiders become able to move thru them (they are not opening them, or fix the raiders if possible).
TODO: close the top of mini fortresses, raiders are probably jumping over the big chest there..
TODO: put team smoke behind the mini fortress...

The total NPCs spawn count should be from half the available spawn spots up to the max.
But, as the engine wants to spawn the whole group at once, and it becomes extremelly laggy if there are more than 5 NPCs hunting you, I had to lower it.
TODO: NPCs should spawn where they are configured to in the prefab, but only at most 3 alive per time at once, to cope with zombies spawning, all the triangles being drawn and grant at least 15FPS to be minimally playable. Spawning NPCs using the gameevents will not help on placing them where they should spawn, at their high ground advantage locations, they will just spawn anywhere around the player, so that is not an option. Configuring the spawns trying to make them happen slowerly, didnt help (did I do it wrong?).
TODO: maniquins are used as decoys/scarecrows, but they are too easy to distinguish from NPCs and players. There could have some alternative.

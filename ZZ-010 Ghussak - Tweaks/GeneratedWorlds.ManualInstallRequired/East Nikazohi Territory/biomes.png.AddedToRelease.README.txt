Install the biomes.png file:
	After generating the world with the specified values,
	this biomes.png must replace the one auto generated by engine RWG
	BEFORE creating the world (before starting a new game),
	so that the manual edits made in gimp (using pencil hardness 100% with exact colorpicker color value)
	will properly apply (starting a new game before copying this file will prevent it from being loaded).

Preparing your own biomes.png file, painting tips:
	- all towns are end game regions (too many concentrated buildings), wasteland (orange)
	- all tall building are end game, wasteland (orange)
	- mountains medium height to tip: snow (white)
	- around mountains place forest (dark green) and burnt forest (purple)
	- between mountains place desert color
	- the place/building where a trader is specifically located, use anything but wasteland, but around it can be wasteland. Unless the trader is in a town, then it is using hazmat suit and everything will be wasteland.

after generating the world with the specified values,
this biomes.png must replace the one auto generated by engine RWG
BEFORE creating the world (before starting a new game),
otherwise the manual edits made in gimp (using pencil hardness 100% with exact colorpicker color value)
wont be applied (wont apply in a world that was created before overwriting this file).

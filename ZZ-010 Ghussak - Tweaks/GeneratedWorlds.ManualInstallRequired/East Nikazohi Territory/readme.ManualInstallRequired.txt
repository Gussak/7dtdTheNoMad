# Open your user folder:
#   "Application Data/7DaysToDie/GeneratedWorlds/East Nikazohi Territory" 
# And copy these files (after backuping existing ones):
#   prefabs.xml
#   spawnpoints.xml
# 
# Obs.: 
#   prefabs.xml:
#     rwgImprovePOIs.sh will change prefabs.xml replacing all duplicated POIs with others that are not already in that file, but prefabs will be placed not connected with the surrounding environment/terrain.
#     I did not change the POI placement Y position because I liked the results, but a new release may contain an alternative prefabs.xml with POIs placed as near to the ground as possible. If you prefer that way and end up changing them, your contribution will be welcome :)
#   spawnpoints.xml: 
#     the spawns are in hazardous areas only, but safe enough to let you join the game w/o dieing. Read the letter quickly and prepare to hide or run!
# 
# PS.: 
#   IF YOU DONT LIKE SURPRISES, SEE SPOILERS AT THE END. 
#   But not reading them may prove incredibly fun when you find out while exploring the world ;)











































































































# SPOILERS:
#  + If you see some roads and no POIs nearby, dig the ground, they are below it! Beware tho as that "ceiling" will probably collapse.

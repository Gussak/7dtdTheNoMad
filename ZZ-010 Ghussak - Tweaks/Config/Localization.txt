They are meant to \nprovide basic (a bit more than minimal) survival conditions \nand access to otherwise (probably) unavailable \nfunctionalities that provides a broader experience.\n Read all the notes, preferably in order.\n !Find someone to hire (read NPC section)!\n But if you die, remember that you can craft a new starter \nbundle, so you do not need try to spawn on your bed.\n"

But the heavier armor you are already using, the more energy will be consumed per hit.\n - Harvest: Will transform most of the shock damage you receive into battery charge. Try hitting a functional vending machine, but be ready to heal yourself too.\n - Hero: Will let you jump much higher, run much faster, will enable a thorns burst nova (if thorns mod is installed), but will cause damage while it is active and will consume a lot of battery energy.\n - Teleport: This is a highly unstable tech device at low teleport mod levels. Will let you teleport nearby or to the sky (TechNote*1), but if too damaged it may enter in a destructive loop. Be careful when using this mod!

jeGSKTRTNMNewGameTip117," [ Workarounds to bugs or other issues ]\n If you can't place a map marker, hit F1 two times (open/close console).\n If you can't type text in any field or if mouse sensitivity becomes super high, hit Alt+Enter to go window mode, move the window down a bit, alt+tab to any other app (or minimize everything to show desktop or hit F12 to open guake/yakuake on linux), and directly click on the game window, then hit Alt+Enter again to go full screen.\n To avoid messing the mouse sensitivity, always start the game with the console opened, this prevents game's mouse grabbing while you use other apps.\n If you can't change the wielded item (probably the weapon you just repaired) on hand, and can't use any other item from inventory, try to unequip or change some armor piece, everything may just work normally again.\n If the rocket from launcher does not hit anything, be sure to wait 1s after it reloads before firing it, do not hold the fire button while it is reloading, you need to wait the animation end and count 1s.\n (*1) On single player, you can try hitting ESC to let the world be generated while you are falling from the sky, so it may lag less (not sure if this really helps tho...)\n (*2) While falling from the sky, the slow fall trick will unintentionally keep closing your inventory or map, so you wont be able to use them properly.\n (*3) While falling from the sky, looking upwards and tracking thru the map may lag less (not sure if this really helps tho...)\n (*4) Teleporting over or near a car, even if it do not explode, will damage you, IDK why, but could be the explosion damage reflected on the car? :)\n (*5) NPC sneaking workaround is meant to work only for that. If you find a way to have any advantage (other than avoid spending thrown rocks) using that, please tell me.\n"

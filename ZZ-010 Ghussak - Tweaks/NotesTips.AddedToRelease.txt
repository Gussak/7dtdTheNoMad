+&Survive!;<property name="CustomIconTint" value="255,0,0" />
 Place a bed! Equip armor (with Elctrn mods).
 Equip molotovs or stungrenades, the gun and reload it.
 Find a place to hide and use some anti-rads as soon you need.
 If you first spawned in snow or radioactive wasteland, and find out you need to relocate to desert or pine forest, read Elctrn devices section about Teleportation and do not equip your Elctrn Teleport mod yet as it will get damaged, prepare yourself for the Teleport To Sky activation, and do it calmly and carefully, read all related info before proceding!
 Cook (and plant) some pine seeds.
 Refuel your torch and recharge your battery.
 Completely fill up your belt carefully, suggestion: gun, ammo, bandages, antirad, batteries, bed, torch, bow, arrows, splint.
 Wait for the night time to explore, with a bow in hand, some stones and use NV.
 Don't leave the area you woke up until you feel prepared.
 Read any schematics you want, but I suggest reading them all as traders' inventory are empty now. They are meant to provide basic (a bit more than minimal) survival conditions and access to otherwise (probably) unavailable functionalities that provides a broader experience.
 Read all the notes, preferably in order.
 !Find someone to hire (read NPC section)!
 But if you die, remember that you can craft a new starter bundle, so you do not need try to spawn on your bed.
 
+Experience Penalty
 Free bundles are not so free as there is an experience debit time depending on how expensive each is.
 NPCs following you will also decrease your experience income based on how much they are helping.
 The max debit will decrease your experience gain by 95%.
 The max debit happens if you open all possible free bundles at once (this is the max reference value).
 The debit remaining time will decrease 1/s.
 The debit percent will is based on the current/max exp debit ratio.
 There are 2 items you can craft with coins to lower your debit by 1K or 10K. You can wait for the debit to end tho, this is recommended to play like that if you want a more challenging start.
 
+Combat
 Install thorns as soon you can and make it sure it is working (look on the HUD).
 !Craft a bow to let you kill zombies at night w/o being detected.
 !Craft a spear to let you spare bullets.
 !Finish rad zombies first as they heal the others.
 Dodge always: let one reach you, step backward and hit the head, good timing and good aim may save you.
 Build mini structures to keep zombies away while you kill them with the spear (1 block tall, 1 space between, then another 2 blocks tall. then jump from 1bt to 2bt).

+Hired NPCs
 Some NPCs can be hired. Melee ones are much cheaper, but they can at least be the tank.
 You can have only one follower (unless you are playing only using melee weapons and have high charisma), but you can craft an item that will keep many followers around for short time.
 She have a strike limit (a limit of how many times they can hit enemies), after that they will be auto-dismissed (but you can dismiss before that limit to 'refill' their ammo thru re-hiring), and just before that you will hear a sound coming from her.
 ExpPenalty: Everytime a follower hits an enemy you will receive a small experience penalty that will wear off with time.
 You can 'craft a power armor' for the one following you (it is +- the price difference from a NPC that comes with power armor already).
 Everytime you re-hire a NPC that did not came with power armor, you have to re-craft the power armor item for her as the previous one will be lost (the reason is the price difference from the NPC that already comes with power armor, to keep prices even).
 You can craft healing items for your follower, but she needs to be nearby or it wont heal her.
 Her armor will not last forever, so eventually you will need to hire another follower.
 Keep your coins to keep your NPC follower around.
 When exploring (T.E.*1)
 Obs.: the NPC armor is only repaired after being hit, so the repair value will remain high and the armor damage too til that happens.

+Tactical Exploring
 Think before moving away from a safe location. Tall buildings may not be so safe as there are probably more radiactive zombies. Think what you must do between one location to another.
 (*1) A NPC that is in hunting mode will attract more foes and it may become impossible to save it from death, so better put it in full control mode or just to follow you, and dont forget to give it a custom power armor. Also, drink 3 beers and sneak-run at nigh, this will help zombies lose track of the NPC. Craft and enable GSKCFGNPCproperSneakingWorkaround too if you prefer, so enemies lured by your follower NPC will be knock down and made invencible for some time, but only if you do not attack nor get nearby another standing NPC (W*5).
 !Night: Walk at night, even w/o nightvision, throw rocks to move zombies and reach quest targets safely.
 Night: Remember that the night is your friend but don't be careless!
 Night: Use glowing sticks to not require equiping a torch or flash light for some time while you still do not have head light or have not yet fully repaired your NV device.
 Place as many beds you need, never move too far w/o placing a bed.
 Suggested initial skills: Run&Gun, Rule1Cardio, AnimalTrack (this will also let you track radiated zombies).
 If you find a new place, before going to it, stop and think beforehand how to use it to survive and focus on doing that initially.
 Keep an eye on the clock, zombies spawn times are critical now.
 If you are alone, as soon you find a good place, try to wait a few days, some NPC may show up that may agree on being hired.
 Your noises will be muffled if you are in rain (ETC*3).
 AirDrops: When tracking an air drop, mark where you are named like AirDropFrom and mark the direction where it will land like AirDropTo. When you go search for it, place a quick waypoint at AirDropFrom, and track AirDropTo. That line is your reference to find it. It makes sounds now if you are near.
 UndergroundPOIs: to initiate it's ceilig collapsing, you can destroy something on the surface or place a block there. There is a smoke hint too nearby.

+Tactical Defense
 Stay away from zombies reach as much you can.
 !Quickly reach any wall and place a ladder on 3rd block high.
 !Block their path and fix your barricade, use trussing frame that is fast to place (no need to rotate), you can shoot thru and you can place traps and pick up drops thru too.
 !Keep always in mind your nearest/best escape route, you will often need it.
 Use the 1blockCrouch feature to design escape routes.
 Always close the doors behind you!
 Climb up ladders looking to the behind and downwards while moving backwards so you are not surprised by sleepers.

+Tactical Infiltrating buildings
 Infiltrate buildings from the top, so you have a chance to spot sleeping zombies (but, a cosmic ray may hit you and make you fall thru, beware).
 Be careful while infiltrating buildings, always block paths before advancing, always place a ladder (one at 3 blocks high) to jump and get out of their reach inside the building.
 Before Infiltrating buildings, make sure you have some anti radiation chems ready, the strong one and the resistance at least.

+Elctrn: Mod Devices Generic info
 Electronic devices (TVs, Computers etc) have silver and gold that you can use to create and upgrade Elctrn mods.
 You can create battery charges on the run or on workbenches and chem stations. But you will charge much more if you place 2 NVBatteryChargePosts and step between them. You will need at least 6 tier 1 batteries to do that tho as 2 posts require 160w. You can use other generators also with the posts of course.
 These devices will degrade and malfunction, so keep them repaired.
 Some electric devices consume a bit battery energy if they are in the standby mode and a lot more when they are actively used:
 Energy can be negative, so you can use some devices (like teleport) one last time. It will stay negative until you charge it. Many devices will stop working when it is negative.
 If you die, they all will be deactivated, so you have to remove and equip your armor parts again.

+Elctrn: Mods
 - Battery: Will increase the battery capacity a lot for each level you upgrade it. Overcharing a battery will get you shocked so be careful!
 - ElctrnThorns: Will let you have some time to react after being hit, and it can be installed on ranged and melee weapons and tools too.
 - EnergyShield: Will be like a second whole body armor on the highest upgrade level. But the heavier armor you are already using, the more energy will be consumed per hit.
 - Harvest: Will transform most of the shock damage you receive into battery charge. Try hitting a functional vending machine, but be ready to heal yourself too.
 - Hero: Will let you jump much higher, run much faster, will enable a thorns burst nova (if thorns mod is installed), but will cause damage while it is active and will consume a lot of battery energy.
 - Teleport: This is a highly unstable tech device at low teleport mod levels. Will let you teleport nearby or to the sky (TechNote*1), but if too damaged it may enter in a destructive loop. Be careful when using this mod! If you are well trained in related skill it will be damaged less when used. It will shock you and increase your radiation, be prepared to heal yourself fast. Avoid using it near your camp, and if chaos begin, keep trying to open inventory and then unequip the armor part with the teleport mod or it may be fatal! Teleporting to sky will highly damage your mod and may destroy it. Avoid using if the mod is damaged beyond {cvar(iGSKDmgSafePercTPShow:0)}% as it may teleport you wrongly! Btw, if you teleport over or near a car, you may probably die (even if the car do not explode (WOR*4)).

+Elctrn: Other Devices
 [NightVision, Flashlight and Headlight]
 - They consume battery when active and have no standby.
 - If battery is too low, they will start blinking Off/On for a short time.
 - If battery is depleted they will blink On/Off from time to time and will keep an energy debit that you will need to charge later.
 - If you get hit while they are active, they will degrade faster and they will blink for a short time. 
 - They will slowly degrade if inactive.

+Hazards
 NearDeathConditions: There are several near death conditions that increase in level based in time or intensity. Each level will slow your movement, attacks, will mess your vision and slowly damage your health and lower your max health and stamina.
 - CosmicRayBeamsRadiation: This world is pierced by Cosmic Rays Beams (strong Cosmic Radiation), from tiny holes in the Ozone Layer, in many places. It is invisible, and if you stay too long on the spot you will die. Hazmat suit can't protect you from it. And when it strikes you, the surrounding nearby environment will disintegrate and you may get teleported too. It will also very slowly damage your DNA in an irreversible way. Avoid also moving over or near vehicles because you will be damaged too (WOR*4).
 - (NDC)Miasma: You can clean miasma by taking a bath (diving), also by using jars of water with the secondary action. Miasma will make you vomit and lose a bit of food and water. This is worse in pine forest. Harvesting corpses will also increase your miasma and to properly harvest corpses it is better to first do a weak strike that will activate the full harvesting amount. Corpse bags requires stepping over them to properly harvest tho.
 - (NDC)Cold and Heat: equip related protection cloths and mods, but you need to keep them repaired too or they wont protect you. Check your CoreTemperature(CT) on the ElctrnHUD, should be > -10. You can combat overheating eating snowballs but it may be dangerous.
 - (NDC)Dry Air: in hot desert environment you need to keep well hydrated all the time, if not even your nose may bleed.
 - (NDC)Frostbyte: may happen rarely but with a big value. You can overheat to cure frostbyte faster.
 - (NDC)Radiation: wasteland biome has 'natural' radiation, better move away initially until you find some hazmat suit parts. Use anti-radiation chems. The radiation resistance chem, when using above it's time limit, it will increase the radiation resistance a little bit. Can be harvested from mutant bunnies.
 - (NDC)Poison: slowly kills you, use anti-poison prepared from snakes and spiders' poison (ETC*1).
 - (NDC)BloodLoss: if you lose too much blood you will eventually die. You can harvest your own blood using medical blood bags. Use blood bags to restore your lost blood. For now every blood bag is O-.
 - (NDC)HitpointBlockage by chem usage: after you use chems to increase any power in any way, you have to wait or use healing, healthy or feeding items to recover. Obs.: The related HUD info may take some time to update.
 - (NDC)Bloated: eating too much will be dangerous. Try the vomit activator if you are unable to lower it in time.
 - (NDC)Overhydration: too much water is extermely dangerous, some consumables can lower your water level. Try the vomit activator if you are unable to lower it in time.

+Hazards:Tips
 - (Tip)In any biome, 100% sheltered is the best option to survive at lower levels.
 - (Tip)Survive Worst Cold in SnowBiome, minimum required: 100% sheltered inside 10 cube blocks (no doors) at midnight and snow falling, with a lit campfire (just outside shelter, and always leave some extra wood and torch fuel on it), a torch and a full set of fiber clothes, poncho and bandana, all easy to craft.
 - (Tip)Shelter can be this shape: (this can be considered a glitch, if you dont like it dont try to read it) P.lL#oAc_TaE*l
 - (Tip)Rain blurs vision: while it is raining your vision may randomly blur. You can drink it, and it may be dangerous, but the Water Purifier mod will protect you. You can enable drinking rain using GSKCFGDrinkRainAllowed.
 - (Tip)Exercise and stay fit as too much food will increase your body fat and lower your maximum stamina, tho some extra fat will help you if you are starving.

+Bestiary
 MutantBunny: A heavly mutated bunny with psyonic powers (ETC*1). It wont hunt you. It will damage you from far away (chances are lowered when sheltered) and run away. It is a good source of anti-radiation chemicals.
 MutantZombie: Apparenly it seems to think like a bunny now, but this one will hunt you. Be careful when hitting them, they can make you teleport randomly (ETC*1)(ETC*2).
 RadiatedVultures: have psyonic powers too (ETC*1). It is a good source of anti-radiation chemicals.
 Spiders and snakes: they will poison you and are also your source of poison to make anti-poison and use in arrows (ETC*1).
 Spiders: throw spider net that will almost prevent you from moving and attacking. Equip a melee weapon, crouch and stand up to try to break free.
 Radiactive zombies: they will regenerate all nearby zombies, so kill them first! they also will harm you from far away adding radiation to your body (ETC*1).
 WightZombies: they are the fastest runners, watch out!
 Beasts with fangs (wolves, dogs, coyotes, bears, boars) may hold you up for a few seconds (ETC*1).
 Bears and boars may knock you down (ETC*1).
 Obs.: in general, these monsters are more prone to thrive (being more powerful and dangerous) in pine forest biome.

+Generic equipment careful usage
 Be sure to carefully charge the battery to not get shocked.
 A makeshift wrench will help but keep it repaired or it may break!
 If something appears to not be working, make it sure they are in good repair condition and if they require energy do recharge batteries and fill up fuel.
 
+ETC
 Traders: Now they are common but strong survivors doing well, and they are not willing to sell anything. If you want anything from them you will have to perform their difficult tasks. But they will still buy anything from you.
 TreasureMaps: raiders want the treasure too now.
 QuestsWithTreasure: raiders want the treasure too now.
 WorkStations: Take your time to gather resources to fix destroyed work stations, so when you find them it will help a lot.
 AirDrops: Mark a probability line from where you are to where the airdrop landed so you won't need to rush for it.
 World: This world is meant to be played w/o building a fortress, so keep exploring!
 DiveSwimSpeed: You can dive swim much faster now, as fast as you think it should be.
 Torch: It requires fuel to stay lit. When you attack with it and set a mob on fire, it consumes a lot of fuel. You can use gas or fat as fuel. fuel mods can be converted into an item that when used increase the combustible fuel limit a bit.
 MapMarkes: Always create map markers with useful info, be careful to avoid confusing descriptions.
 FallingAndKnockdown: everytime you fall, there is a chance for you to be knocked down, higher falls have greater chances and damaged legs also increase it, but staying healed will lower these chances.
 (*1) PoisoningEnemies: Enemies that get poisoned by you or another NPC wont be able to use special abilities while the poison is active.
 (*2) PsyonicResistance: will protect you against enemies psyonic abilities, including mutant forced teleport.
 (*3) RainDetection: It is not possible to know if it is raining right? so the only way to know that is if the player is wet.

 [ GAMEPLAY ]
 After joining a game, always adjust the inventory 'Lock first N slots' otherwise as soon you click sort you lose all work you put on organizing items!
 If you have a NPC following you, and it quickly starts moving very far away very fast, the only thing that will bring it back is to mount some vehicle. I was unable to prepare a dummy but working vehicle (based on bicycle) for that workaround.
 If you use some item and nothing happens (like rad resist chem or fast swimming), try crafting and using this item GSKWorkAroundFixBuffs to force related buff to kick in initially. Such problem may not happen again after that.
 [ ETC ]
 Some buffs descriptions can be found in free craftable notes, they may have dynamic value too.
 If you think new helpful tips could be added, or better explained, drop a comment so I can review it.
 I dont know if I missed something, these tips were created after I coded it all. If you think a new tip should be added, tell me, thx!
 If you are a mod developer, the bash scripts may be useful for you too, but you need Cygwin or Linux to run them.
 The main mod can be still split into several independent mini mods. I may do that someday.
 If something weird, not expected, unintended or not explained happens, please send me some lines from the file 'AppData/LocalLow/The Fun Pimps/7 Days To Die/Player.log', it may help me recreate the problem.

+WORKAROUNDS
 [ Workarounds to bugs or other issues ]
 If you can't place a map marker, hit F1 two times (open/close console).
 If you can't type text in any field or if mouse sensitivity becomes super high, hit Alt+Enter to go window mode, move the window down a bit, alt+tab to any other app (or minimize everything to show desktop or hit F12 to open guake/yakuake on linux), and directly click on the game window, then hit Alt+Enter again to go full screen.
 To avoid messing the mouse sensitivity, always start the game with the console opened, this prevents game's mouse grabbing while you use other apps.
 If you can't change the wielded item (probably the weapon you just repaired) on hand, and can't use any other item from inventory, try to unequip or change some armor piece, everything may just work normally again.
 If the rocket from launcher does not hit anything, be sure to wait 1s after it reloads before firing it, do not hold the fire button while it is reloading, you need to wait the animation end and count 1s.
 (*1) On single player, you can try hitting ESC to let the world be generated while you are falling from the sky, so it may lag less (not sure if this really helps tho...)
 (*2) While falling from the sky, the slow fall trick will unintentionally keep closing your inventory or map, so you wont be able to use them properly.
 (*3) While falling from the sky, looking upwards and tracking thru the map may lag less (not sure if this really helps tho...)
 (*4) Teleporting over or near a car, even if it do not explode, will damage you, IDK why, but could be the explosion damage reflected on the car? :)
 (*5) NPC sneaking workaround is meant to work only for that. If you find a way to have any advantage (other than avoid spending thrown rocks) using that, please tell me.

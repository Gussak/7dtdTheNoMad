+&Survive!;<property name="CustomIconTint" value="255,0,0" />
 Place a bed! Equip armor (with Elctrn mods).
 Equip molotovs or stungrenades, the gun and reload it.
 Find a place to hide and use some anti-rads as soon you need.
 If you first spawned in snow or radioactive wasteland, and find out you need to relocate to desert or pine forest, read Elctrn devices section about Teleportation and do not equip your Elctrn Teleport mod yet as it will get damaged, prepare yourself for the Teleport To Sky activation, and do it calmly and carefully, read all related info before proceding!
 Cook (and plant) some pine seeds.
 Refuel your torch and recharge your battery.
 Craft a pipe baton, it will work like a nice cheap shield by parrying attacks.
 Completely fill up your belt carefully, suggestion: gun, ammo, bandages, antirad, batteries, bed, torch, bow, arrows, splint.
 Wait for the night time to explore, with a bow in hand, some stones and use NV.
 Don't leave the area you woke up until you feel prepared.
 Read any schematics you want (see *Delivery), but I suggest reading them all as traders' inventory are empty now. They are meant to provide basic (a bit more than minimal) survival conditions and access to otherwise (probably) unavailable functionalities that provides a broader experience.
 Chose a few notes to read, I suggest at least the bestiary.
 !Find someone to hire (read NPC section)!
 But if you die, remember that you can craft a new starter bundle, so you do not need try to spawn on your bed.
 
+Experience Penalty
 Free bundles (see *Delivery) are not so free as there is an experience debit time depending on how expensive each is. You will call a courier that will bring the package to you, they can't be hired tho.
 NPCs following you will also decrease your experience income based on how much they are helping.
 The max debit will decrease your experience gain by 95%.
 The max debit happens if you open all possible free bundles at once several times after many resurrections (this is the max reference value).
 The debit remaining time will decrease {cvar(.fGSKExpDebtDecPerSec:0.00)}/s.
 The debit percent will is based on the current/max exp debit ratio.
 There are 2 items you can craft with coins to lower your debit by 1K or 10K. You can wait for the debit to end tho, this is recommended to play like that if you want a more challenging start.
 
+Delivery
 Free bundles and world exploration rewards are delivered by couriers.
 The more valuable the delivery, the stronger the courier will be.
 Couriers cannot be hired.
 Deliveries won't happen on bloodmoons as couriers are also fighting for their lives somewhere else.
 
+Combat
 Install thorns as soon you can and make it sure it is working (look on the HUD).
 !Craft a bow to let you kill zombies at night w/o being detected.
 !Craft a spear to let you spare bullets.
 !Finish rad zombies first as they heal the others.
 Dodge always: let one reach you, step backward and hit the head, good timing and good aim may save you.
 Build mini structures to keep zombies away while you kill them with the spear (1 block tall, 1 space between, then another 2 blocks tall. then jump from 1bt to 2bt).
 Melee weapons now let you parry damage, the higher the tier the better (ETC*4).
 Melee hit a foe and jump, you will kick and knock it down.
 Dodge chance by crouching, standing and jumping.
 Place your bed far away from the combat zone of the blood moon day. It is important to keep your bed in a safe place far away from the ranged attacks and explosions. Resurrecting on it may also not be a good idea as you will lure mobs near it, unless you are lucky and also quickly run away from it.

+Hired NPCs
 Some NPCs can be hired. Melee ones are much cheaper, but they can at least be the tank.
 FollowerLimit: If you equip a ranged weapon, the ranged NPC limit that can follow you will be only one. If you unequip the ranged weapon (melee build (ETC*4)), the limit of ranged NPCs that can follow you is based on your charisma: c1=f1 c2c3=f2 c4=f3. There is no limit to melee followers (other than how many your CPU can handle). You can also craft an item that will keep many followers around for short time NPCPreventDismiss60s.
 She have a strike limit (a limit of how many times they can hit enemies), after that they will be auto-dismissed (but you can dismiss before that limit to 'refill' their ammo thru re-hiring), and just before that you will hear a sound coming from her.
 ExpPenalty: Everytime a follower hits an enemy you will receive a small experience penalty that will wear off with time.
 You can 'craft a power armor' for the one following you (it is +- the price difference from a NPC that comes with power armor already).
 Everytime you re-hire a NPC that did not came with power armor, you have to re-craft the power armor item for her as the previous one will be lost (the reason is the price difference from the NPC that already comes with power armor, to keep prices even).
 You can craft healing items for your follower, but she needs to be nearby or it wont heal her.
 Her armor will not last forever, so eventually you will need to hire another follower.
 Keep your coins to keep your NPC follower around.
 When exploring (T.E.*1)
 Don't be fooled tho... trying to save them will most likely get you killed. Ranged ones with automatic guns are more helpful. But anyway, it is usually better to leave them in a safe place while you explore a new POI.
 If you are teleported underground by a cosmic ray strike and you have followers, they probably wont be teleported down there with you. If that happens, you can dig a bigger place around, big enough to let you place the vehicleGSKNPChelperPlaceable so you can bring them to where you are. Remember also that they may be holding fire if you were sneaking at night, and you have to let them fight while you prepare the place to call them to you. Another tip is that there probably are many zombies up there and you can use them to dig the ground above for you, just be prepared to when they reach you!
 When you reach a new POI, try to place your followers waiting on some safe spot (usually on the top of the building) while you clean it from sleepers, just remember to run back to them if you need.
 Tip: Harvesting some blocks may let you call special hireable NPCs, but you will need to help them before hiring (and it won't be easy). Look for: FlagPoles, PoolTables, Candelabras, Chandeliers and DogHouses.
 Obs.: the NPC armor is only repaired after being hit, so the repair value will remain high and the armor damage too til that happens.
 PS.: beware, they may push you from edges when being teleported to you.

+Tactical Exploring
 ExplorationRewards: The more you explore, the more you have a chance to get a few of them (so chose what you buy wisely). Each POI has a W.E.R. (World Exploration Rewards' Tower of Trials) with special blocks surrouded by explosives (the higher the better). If you are careful (and lucky) you can harvest that block and not die. If you are unable to harvest it and remain alive, read (ETC*7), it may help but is not granted. There is also the Underground POI reward, you have to make the chimneys with smoke fall to get the reward (dig below them read ETC*12).
 Think before moving away from a safe location. Tall buildings may not be so safe as there are probably more radiactive zombies. Think what you must do between one location to another.
 NPC: (*1) A NPC that is in hunting mode will attract more foes and it may become impossible to save it from death, so better put it in full control mode or just to follow you, and dont forget to give it a custom power armor. Also, drink 3 beers and sneak-run at nigh, this will help zombies lose track of the NPC.
 NPC: Craft and enable GSKCFGNPCproperSneakingWorkaround too if you prefer, so enemies lured by your follower NPC will be knock down and made invencible for some time, but only if you do not attack nor get nearby another standing NPC (W*5) nor equip any light source (throw glow sticks instead). Hunting is not advised unless you are really careful as with any mistake things will go crazy really quick, so better ignore other NPCs you find on your way unless you feel ready to beat a horde at night.
 !Night: Walk at night, even w/o nightvision, throw rocks to move zombies and reach quest targets safely.
 Night: Remember that the night is your friend but don't be careless!
 Night: Use glowing sticks do not require equiping a torch or flash light for some time while you still do not have head light or have not yet fully repaired your NV device. Scientists found that for some reason, zombies can't see this light, what makes it a safe light source (ETC*5).
 Place as many beds you need, avoid moving too far w/o placing a bed.
 Suggested initial skills: Run&Gun, Rule1Cardio, AnimalTrack (this will also let you track radiated zombies).
 If you find a new place, before going to it, stop and think beforehand how to use it to survive and focus on doing that initially.
 Keep an eye on the clock, zombies spawn times are critical now.
 If you are alone, as soon you find a good place, try to wait a few days, some NPC may show up that may agree on being hired.
 Your noises will be muffled if you are in rain (ETC*3).
 AirDrops: When tracking an air drop, mark where you are named like AirDropFrom and mark the direction where it will land like AirDropTo. When you go search for it, place a quick waypoint at AirDropFrom, and track AirDropTo. That line is your reference to find it. It makes sounds now if you are near.
 UndergroundPOIs: to initiate it's ceilig collapsing, you can destroy something on the surface or place a block there. There is a smoke hint too nearby.
 After you place a bed, do not step on it as there may have a cosmic ray there, or place where you already walked.
 Avoid moving near vehicles, there may have a cosmic ray there and the explosion may kill you (WOR*4).

+Tactical Defense
 Stay away from zombies reach as much you can.
 !Quickly reach any wall and place a ladder on 3rd block high.
 !Block their path and fix your barricade, use trussing frame that is fast to place (no need to rotate), you can shoot thru and you can place traps and pick up drops thru too.
 !Keep always in mind your nearest/best escape route, you will often need it.
 Use the 1blockCrouch feature to design escape routes.
 Always close the doors behind you!
 Climb up ladders looking to the behind and downwards while moving backwards so you are not surprised by sleepers.
 On blood moons prefer large buildings so you can run far away from explosions and place a bed a bit far from where you are defending, that also have full walls at the floor level that takes longer for the zombies to destroy, and preferably with many trap holes around them so you can try to lure zombies to each.

+Tactical Infiltrating buildings
 Infiltrate buildings from the top, so you have a chance to spot sleeping zombies (but, a cosmic ray may hit you and make you fall thru, beware).
 Be careful while infiltrating buildings, always block paths before advancing, always place a ladder (one at 3 blocks high) to jump and get out of their reach inside the building.
 Before Infiltrating buildings, make sure you have some anti radiation chems ready, the strong one and the resistance at least.
 And remember that walking on the edges of buildings' roof top is the best option against cosmic ray explosions.
 Mutant essence will help against cosmic ray strikes.
 On the other hand, infiltrating from below may help on prevent falling near sleeping zombies from a cosmic ray explosion hole.

+Elctrn: Mod Devices Generic info
 Electronic devices (TVs, Computers etc) have silver and gold that you can use to create and upgrade Elctrn mods.
 You can create battery charges on the run or on workbenches and chem stations. But you will charge much more if you place 2 NVBatteryChargePosts and step between them. You will need at least 6 tier 1 batteries to do that tho as 2 posts require 160w. You can use other generators also with the posts of course.
 These devices will degrade and malfunction, so keep them repaired.
 Some electric devices consume a bit battery energy if they are in the standby mode and a lot more when they are actively used:
 Energy can be negative, so you can use some devices (like teleport) one last time. It will stay negative until you charge it. Many devices will stop working when it is negative.
 If you die, they all will be deactivated, so you have to remove and equip your armor parts again.

+Elctrn: Mods
 - Battery: Will increase the battery capacity a lot for each level you upgrade it. Overcharing a battery will get you shocked so be careful!
 - ElctrnThorns: Will let you have some time to react after being hit, and it can be installed on ranged and melee weapons and tools too.
 - EnergyShield: Will be like a second whole body armor on the highest upgrade level. But the heavier armor you are already using, the more energy will be consumed per hit.
 - Harvest: Will transform most of the shock damage you receive into battery charge. Try hitting a functional vending machine, but be ready to heal yourself too.
 - Hero: Will let you jump much higher, run much faster, will enable a thorns burst nova (if thorns mod is installed), but will cause damage while it is active and will consume a lot of battery energy.
 - Teleport: This is a highly unstable tech device at low teleport mod levels. Will let you teleport nearby or to the sky (TechNote*1), but if too damaged it may enter in a destructive loop. Be careful when using this mod! If you are well trained in related skill it will be damaged less when used. It will shock you and increase your radiation, be prepared to heal yourself fast. Avoid using it near your camp, and if chaos begin, keep trying to open inventory and then unequip the armor part with the teleport mod or it may be fatal! Teleporting to sky will highly damage your mod and may destroy it. Avoid using if the mod is damaged beyond {cvar(iGSKDmgSafePercTPShow:0)}% as it may teleport you wrongly! Btw, if you teleport over or near a car, you may probably die (even if the car do not explode (WOR*4)).

+Elctrn: Other Devices
 [NightVision, Flashlight and Headlight]
 - They consume battery when active and have no standby.
 - If battery is too low, they will start blinking Off/On for a short time.
 - If battery is depleted they will blink On/Off from time to time and will keep an energy debit that you will need to charge later.
 - If you get hit while they are active, they will degrade faster and they will blink for a short time. 
 - They will slowly degrade if inactive.

+Hazards
 NearDeathConditions: There are several near death conditions that increase in level based in time or intensity. Each level will slow your movement, attacks, will mess your vision and slowly damage your health and lower your max health and stamina.
 - CosmicRayBeamsRadiation: This world is pierced by Cosmic Rays Beams (strong Cosmic Radiation), from tiny holes in the Ozone Layer, in many places. It is invisible, and if you stay too long on the spot you will die. Hazmat suit can't protect you from it. And when it strikes you, the surrounding nearby environment will disintegrate and you may get teleported too. It will also very slowly damage your DNA. Avoid also moving over or near vehicles because you will be damaged too (WOR*4). Blood Moon interferes with cosmic rays and actually helps and heals you.
 - (NDC)Miasma: You can clean miasma by taking a bath (diving), also by using jars of water with the secondary action. Miasma will make you vomit and lose a bit of food and water. This is worse in pine forest. Harvesting corpses will also increase your miasma and to properly harvest it is better to first do a careful weak strike (that will activate the full harvesting amount for a few seconds) and then you can do strong strikes to cut more. Corpse bags requires stepping over them to properly harvest tho.
 - (NDC)Cold and Heat: equip related protection cloths and mods, but you need to keep them repaired too or they wont protect you. Check your CoreTemperature(CT) on the ElctrnHUD, should be > -10. You can combat overheating eating snowballs but it may be dangerous.
 - (NDC)Dry Air: in hot desert environment you need to keep well hydrated all the time, if not even your nose may bleed.
 - (NDC)Frostbyte: may happen rarely but with a big value. You can overheat to cure frostbyte faster.
 - (NDC)Radiation: wasteland biome has 'natural' radiation, better move away initially until you find some hazmat suit parts. Use anti-radiation chems. The radiation resistance chem, when using above it's time limit, it will increase the radiation resistance a little bit. Can be harvested from mutant bunnies.
 - (NDC)Poison: slowly kills you, use anti-poison prepared from snakes and spiders' poison (ETC*1).
 - (NDC)BloodLoss: if you lose too much blood you will eventually die. You can harvest your own blood using medical blood bags. Use blood bags to restore your lost blood. For now every blood bag is O-.
 - (NDC)HitpointBlockage by chem usage: after you use chems to increase any power in any way, you have to wait or use healing, healthy or feeding items to recover. Obs.: The related HUD info may take some time to update.
 - (NDC)Bloated: eating too much will be dangerous. Try the vomit activator if you are unable to lower it in time.
 - (NDC)Overhydration: too much water is extermely dangerous, some consumables can lower your water level. Try the vomit activator if you are unable to lower it in time.

+Hazards:Tips
 - (Tip)In any biome, 100% sheltered is the best option to survive at lower levels.
 - (Tip)Survive Worst Cold in SnowBiome, minimum required: 100% sheltered inside 10 cube blocks (no doors) at midnight and snow falling, with a lit campfire (just outside shelter, and always leave some extra wood and torch fuel on it), a torch and a full set of fiber clothes, poncho and bandana, all easy to craft.
 - (Tip)Shelter can be this shape: (this can be considered a glitch, if you dont like it dont try to read it) P.lL#oAc_TaE*l
 - (Tip)Rain blurs vision: while it is raining your vision may randomly blur. You can drink it, and it may be dangerous, but the Water Purifier mod will protect you. You can enable drinking rain using GSKCFGDrinkRainAllowed.
 - (Tip)Exercise and stay fit as too much food will increase your body fat, lower your maximum stamina, your run speed, increase your stumble chances from falling down, tho some extra fat will help you if you are starving and help to prevent hold up from dog byte and knockdown from big foes strikes.
 - (Tip)Starving will make you move and think (craft) slower, will affect your vision from time to time, will make ou need more water, will burn fat to keep you alive, your weak legs may make you fall down, will lower your experience gain a bit, will certainly make you fatigued after some time, will consume/spend a bit of your blood (causing blood loss effect), will increase the bad effects of all biome related hazards, will mess your DNA improvements, will create a HP blockage that can only be removed by being completely well fed for some time. Tho, it will detox and heal you a bit from chem usage.

+Bestiary
 Honor the courage and the blood of many good warriors by reading this bestiary carefully.
 MutantBunny: A heavly mutated bunny with psyonic powers (ETC*1). It wont hunt you. It will damage you from far away (chances are lowered when sheltered) and run away. It is a good source of anti-radiation chemicals. Drops Essence (ETC*10).
 MutantZombie: Apparenly, after eating too many mutant bunnies, it seems to think like a bunny now (after all, you are what you eat right?), but this one will hunt you. Be careful when hitting them, they can make you teleport randomly (ETC*1)(ETC*2).  Drops Essence (ETC*10).
 RadiatedVultures: Ate a lot of mutant bunnies and have psyonic powers too now (ETC*1). It is a good source of anti-radiation chemicals. Drops Essence (ETC*10).
 Spiders and snakes: they will poison you and are also your source of poison to make anti-poison and use in arrows (ETC*1).
 Spiders: throw spider web that will almost prevent you from moving and attacking. Equip a melee weapon, crouch, stand up and jump to try to break free.
 Radiactive zombies: they will regenerate all nearby zombies, so kill them first! they also will harm you from far away adding radiation to your body (ETC*1).
 WightZombies: they are the fastest runners and almost immune to damage, watch out! Obs.: The few that survived it's attacks said that they don't seem to like glowing sticks light. Drops Essence (ETC*10).
 Vampires(Screamers): Vampires may become very strong but only after tasting an enemy blood. They are most powerful at night time and everytime they hit you they will call a few zombie dogs, so letting it get near is not a good idea. Drops Essence (ETC*10).
 Beasts with fangs (wolves, dogs, coyotes, bears, boars, vampires) may hold you up for a few seconds (ETC*1).
 Bears and boars may knock you down (ETC*1).
 DeusExMachina: They appeared in this world in the doom's day. Nobody knows what they want nor why they came and neither how they reached this planet (were they sleeping underground?). They are harmless (unless they step on you or break stuff you built, they are not careful), so even if you attack them (to wake them up), they do not seem to care for the damage that quickly repairs, but then they will start following you (ETC*8). One thing they do for sure is to eliminate zombies. Some say that they carry a good treasure, but as soon you put your hands on it you will be hunted forever. And what nobody understands is why they have rocket launchers in their boots? (ETC*9)
 Mechs: They are 3D printed by DeusExMachinas (only after you manage to kill one of them). They take little damage unless you use a salvage tool. Then can be stunned by shocking attacks.
 Obs.: in general, these monsters are more prone to thrive (being more powerful and dangerous) in pine forest biome.

+Generic equipment careful usage
 Be sure to carefully charge the battery to not get shocked.
 A makeshift wrench will help but keep it repaired or it may break!
 If something appears to not be working, make it sure they are in good repair condition and if they require energy do recharge batteries and fill up fuel.
 You can repair items more carefully by removing most repair parts of your inventory temporarily, and spend guns' condition before scrapping them.
 
+ETC
 Traders: Now they are common but strong survivors doing well, and they are not willing to sell anything. If you want anything from them you will have to perform their difficult tasks. But they will still buy anything from you.
 TreasureMaps: raiders want the treasure too now.
 QuestsWithTreasure: raiders want the treasure too now.
 WorkStations: Take your time to gather resources to fix destroyed work stations, so when you find them it will help a lot.
 AirDrops: Mark a probability line from where you are to where the airdrop landed so you won't need to rush for it.
 World: This world is meant to be played w/o building a fortress, so keep exploring!
 DiveSwimSpeed: You can swim properly now, much faster than zombies, but blood moon makes the water more dense and difficult to swim.
 Torch: It requires fuel to stay lit. When you attack with it and set a mob on fire, it consumes a lot of fuel. You can use gas or fat as fuel. fuel mods can be converted into an item that when used increase the combustible fuel limit a bit. Staying on rain may douse it.
 FreeCraftableConfigurationItems: there are several items to configure things by increasing or decreasing values like the Teleport to biome where you can chose the biome. When the engine have a customizable configuration menu, all these items will have an equivalent there (and could then be removed).
 FreeCraftableActivatorItems: there are several items to activate things like command a DeusExMachina to slow down.
 MapMarkes: Always create map markers with useful info, be careful to avoid confusing descriptions.
 FallingAndKnockdown: everytime you fall, there is a chance for you to stumble and knockdown, higher falls have greater chances and damaged legs also increase it, but staying healed will lower these chances. Equipping an Impact Bracing Mod will help a lot, while crouched it will almost not happen and using steroids will almost prevent it.
 JumpPads: after stepping in one, hold jump (HoJu!) to go as high as possible, but remember that you will still receive a high fall damage if you do not stay up there.
 (*1) PoisoningEnemies: Enemies that get poisoned by you or another NPC wont be able to use special abilities while the poison is active.
 (*2) PsyonicResistance: will protect you against enemies psyonic abilities, including mutant forced teleport.
 (*3) RainDetection: It is not possible to know if it is raining right? so the only way to know that is if the player is wet.
 (*4) MeleeBuild: playing only with melee weapons will give some advantages to let it be an option.
 (*5) GlowStickLight: uses the vomit explosion particles that do not seem to create a light that makes the player detectable in darkness?
 (*6) NPCSneakingVStreasureHunt: when digging treasures, if you keep NPC sneaking workaround enabled it may become impossible because you need to stay there. NPC sneaking workaround is meant to keep moving.
 (*7) Tip to collect exploration rewards while having low armor protection vs explosion: At night time, w/o zombies nearby, use the jump pads and place blocks in front of the explosive blocks below the one you will try to harvest, this helps against the explosions that happen while you are falling by covering the explosive blocks. You can also create a nerdpole with blocks above one of the markers (the harvest distance with a shovel is 3.5 blocks). Obs.: extra blocks can be placed to give structure that may prevent explosions letting you harvest more rewards, but do not trust it! The main instability is on the top. You can harvest the topmost first. Now you can just grab the middle one and move on.. But if you really want the lowest one then you need to create structure to the lower one and also to the middle one before harvesting the middle one. If you are lucky you can leave the lowest to the end, tho it may be too difficult and not possible to prevent the topmost explosive (the hourglass) from exploding. If you want to better understand what is going on, enable dm/ShowStability. Try also to use all essences and a knife, or use one jump pad just to wake up the enemies on the top, but fall down to fight them, and when the tower is cleared, use the other jump pad (you will need some luck for that to work).
 (*8) DeusExMachina and NPC follower: before shooting it to make it follow you, crouch so your NPC follower wont shoot it too. If you crouch after, the NPC follower will stop shooting too. Also they will try to destroy things on their way, even if it is your workbench, so be careful and use the slow DeusEx option (item).
 (*9) DeusExMachina rocketlaucher boots is actually an issue, I cant find a way to make them fire from the head or torso location. Only teleport desintegration can kill it (you will then become their foe). It seems impossible to make them stop attacking, so when they are put to hybernate/standby they just cannot move.
 (*10) MonsterEssences: Using them will accumulate in your body improving you while they are active. Using all possible essences at the same time will improve you more. The more you use in a short time (stacking) the more side effects may happen tho. When you resurrect all accumulated essences DNA modification will be zeroed (DNA full recreation).
 (*11) GameEventSpawnEntity:FailOrWillBePutOnHoldStack: If the player is sheltered (or because being inside some building), these events may not work? they seem to work with tiny spiders everytime, but not for normal height humanoids or big DeusEx.
 (*12) When destroyed blocks drop things, they may fall outside of the world (bug) right? so be sure that all blocks around the block you are going to destroy are cleared too, or the random position may bug and you lose the item.

 [ GAMEPLAY ]
 After joining a game, always adjust the inventory 'Lock first N slots' otherwise as soon you click sort you lose all work you put on organizing items!
 If you have a NPC following you, and it quickly starts moving very far away very fast, the only thing that will bring it back is to mount some vehicle. I was unable to prepare a dummy but working vehicle (based on bicycle) for that workaround.
 If you use some item and nothing happens (like rad resist chem or fast swimming), try crafting and using this item GSKWorkAroundFixBuffs to force related buff to kick in initially. Such problem may not happen again after that.
 - (tip) To update the values on the description of any item, just keep moving the cursor over your inventory slots.
 [ ETC ]
 Some buffs descriptions can be found in free craftable notes, they may have dynamic value too.
 If you think new helpful tips could be added, or better explained, drop a comment so I can review it.
 I dont know if I missed something, these tips were created after I coded it all. If you think a new tip should be added, tell me, thx!
 If you are a mod developer, the bash scripts may be useful for you too, but you need Cygwin or Linux to run them.
 The main mod can be still split into several independent mini mods. I may do that someday.
 If something weird, not expected, unintended or not explained happens, please send me some lines from the file 'Player.log', it may help me recreate the problem.

+WORKAROUNDS
 [ Workarounds to bugs or other issues ]
 Obs.: Everything here is related to specific versions of the game and mods, so they may not be valid on different versions.
 If you can't place a map marker, hit F1 two times (open/close console).
 If you can't type text in any field or if mouse sensitivity becomes super high, hit Alt+Enter to go window mode, move the window down a bit, alt+tab to any other app (or minimize everything to show desktop or hit F12 to open guake/yakuake on linux), and directly click on the game window, then hit Alt+Enter again to go full screen.
 To avoid messing the mouse sensitivity, always start the game with the console opened, this prevents game's mouse grabbing while you use other apps.
 If you can't change the wielded item (probably the weapon you just repaired) on hand, and can't use any other item from inventory, try to remove and put back some items from your quick belt or unequip or change some armor piece, everything may just work normally again after that.
 If the rocket from launcher does not hit anything, be sure to wait 1s after it reloads before firing it, do not hold the fire button while it is reloading, you need to wait the animation end and count 1s.
 Before picking up your backpack after resurrecting, put all new items you got into some container to keep the organization you had on the backpack.
 (*1) On single player, you can try hitting ESC to let the world be generated while you are falling from the sky, so it may lag less (not sure if this really helps tho...)
 (*2) While falling from the sky, the slow fall trick will unintentionally keep closing your inventory or map, so you wont be able to use them properly.
 (*3) While falling from the sky, looking upwards and tracking thru the map may lag less (not sure if this really helps tho...)
 (*4) Teleporting over or near a car, even if it do not explode, will damage you, IDK why, but could be the explosion damage reflected on the car?
 (*5) NPC sneaking workaround is meant to work only for that. If you find a way to have any advantage (other than avoid spending thrown rocks) using that, please tell me.
 (*6) If a ceiling ground of an underground POI is still collapsing, and you step in a cosmic ray spot, the explosion (that should only select enemies) may kill you. I think this happens because of the lag?

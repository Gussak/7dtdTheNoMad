+&Survive!;<property name="CustomIconTint" value="255,0,0" />
 Place a bed! Equip armor (with tesla mods).
 Equip molotovs or stungrenades, the gun and reload it.
 Find a place to hide and use some anti-rads as soon you need.
 If you first spawned in snow or radioactive wasteland, and find out you need to relocate to desert or pine forest, read Tesla devices section about Teleportation and do not equip your Tesla Teleport mod yet as it will get damaged, prepare yourself for the Teleport To Sky activation, and do it calmly and carefully, read all related info before proceding!
 Cook (and plant) some pine seeds.
 Refuel your torch and recharge your battery.
 Completely fill up your belt carefully, suggestion: gun, ammo, bandages, antirad, batteries, bed, torch, bow, arrows, splint.
 Wait for the night time to explore, with a bow in hand, some stones and use NV.
 Don't leave the area you woke up until you feel prepared.
 Read any schematics you want, but I suggest reading them all as traders' inventory are empty now. They are meant to provide basic (a bit more than minimal) survival conditions and access to otherwise (probably) unavailable functionalities that provides a broader experience.
 Read all the notes, preferably in order.
 !!!Find someone to hire (keep your coins for that)!
 But if you die, remember that you can craft a new starter bundle, so you do not need try to spawn on your bed.
 
+Combat
 Install thorns as soon you can and make it sure it is working (look on the HUD).
 !!!Craft a bow to let you kill zombies at night w/o being detected.
 !!!Craft a spear to let you spare bullets.
 !!!Finish rad zombies first as they heal the others.
 Dodge always: let one reach you, step backward and hit the head, good timing and good aim may save you.
 Build mini structures to keep zombies away while you kill them with the spear (1 block tall, 1 space between, then another 2 blocks tall. then jump from 1bt to 2bt).

+Tactical exploring
 !!!Night: Walk at night, even w/o nightvision, throw rocks to move zombies and reach quest targets safely.
 Night: Remember that the night is your friend but don't be careless!
 Night: Use glowing sticks to not require equiping a torch or flash light for some time while you still do not have head light or have not yet fully repaired your NV device.
 Place as many beds you need, never move too far w/o placing a bed.
 Suggested initial skills: Run&Gun, Rule1Cardio, AnimalTrack (this will also let you track radiated zombies).
 If you find a new place, before going to it, stop and think beforehand how to use it to survive and focus on doing that initially.
 Keep an eye on the clock, zombies spawn times are critical now.
 If you are alone, as soon you find a good place, try to wait a few days, someone may show up that may agree on being hired.

+Tactical defense
 Stay away from zombies reach as much you can.
 !!!Quickly reach any wall and place a ladder on 3rd block high.
 !!!Block their path and fix your barricade, use trussing frame that is fast to place (no need to rotate), you can shoot thru and you can place traps and pick up drops thru too.
 !Keep always in mind your nearest/best escape route, you will often need it.
 Use the 1blockCrouch feature to design escape routes.
 Always close the doors behind you!
 Climb up ladders looking to the behind and downwards while moving backwards so you are not surprised by sleepers.

+Tactical Infiltrating buildings
 Infiltrate buildings from the top, so you have a chance to spot sleeping zombies.
 Be careful while infiltrating buildings, always block paths before advancing, always place a ladder (one at 3 blocks high) to jump and get out of their reach inside the building.
 Before Infiltrating buildings, make sure you have some anti radiation chems ready.

+Tesla Mod Devices
 Electronic devices (TVs, Computers etc) have silver and gold that you can use to create and upgrade tesla mods.
 You can create battery charges on the run or on workbenches and chem stations. But you will charge much more if you place 2 NVBatteryChargePosts and step between them. You will need at least 6 tier 1 batteries to do that tho as 2 posts require 160w. You can use other generators also with the posts of course.
 These devices will degrade and malfunction, so keep them repaired.
 Some electric devices consume a bit battery energy if they are in the standby mode and a lot more when they are actively used:
 Energy can be negative, so you can use some devices (like teleport) one last time. It will stay negative until you charge it. Many devices will stop working when it is negative.
 If you die, they all will be deactivated, so you have to remove and equip your armor parts again.
 [Tesla Mods]
 - Battery: Will increase the battery capacity a lot for each level you upgrade it. Overcharing a battery will get you shocked so be careful!
 - TeslaThorns: Will let you have some time to react after being hit, and it can be installed on ranged and melee weapons and tools too.
 - EnergyShield: Will be like a second whole body armor on the highest upgrade level. But the heavier armor you are already using, the more energy will be consumed per hit.
 - Harvest: Will transform most of the shock damage you receive into battery charge. Try hitting a functional vending machine, but be ready to heal yourself too.
 - Hero: Will let you jump much higher, run much faster, will enable a thorns burst nova (if thorns mod is installed), but will cause damage while it is active and will consume a lot of battery energy.
 - Teleport: A highly unstable technology. Will let you teleport nearby or to the sky (see technote *1), but if too damaged it may enter in a destructive loop. Be careful when using this mod! If you are highly skilled it will be damaged less when used.
 [Other devices NightVision, Flashlight and Headlight]
 - They consume battery when active and have no standby.
 - If battery is too low, they will start blinking Off/On for a short time.
 - If battery is depleted they will blink On/Off from time to time and will keep an energy debit that you will need to charge later.
 - If you get hit while they are active, they will degrade faster and they will blink for a short time. 
 - They will slowly degrade if inactive.

+Hazards
 NearDeathConditions: There are several near death conditions that increase in level based in time or intensity. Each level will slow your movement, attacks, will mess your vision and slowly damage your health and lower your max health and stamina.
 - (NDC)Miasma: You can clean miasma by taking a bath (diving), also by using jars of water with the secondary action. Miasma will make you vomit and lose a bit of food and water. This is worse in pine forest.
 - (NDC)Cold and Heat: equip related protection cloths and mods, but you need to keep them repaired too or they wont protect you. Check your CoreTemperature(CT) on the TeslaHUD, should be > -10.
 - (NDC)Dry Air: in hot desert environment you need to keep well hydrated all the time, if not even your nose may bleed.
 - (Tip)Survive Worst Cold in SnowBiome, minimum required: 100% sheltered inside 10 cube blocks (no doors) at midnight and snow falling, with a lit campfire (just outside shelter, and always leave some extra wood and torch fuel on it), a torch and a full set of fiber clothes, poncho and bandana, all easy to craft.
 - (NDC)Frostbyte: may happen rarely but with a big value. You can overheat to cure frostbyte faster.
 - (NDC)Radiation: wasteland biome has 'natural' radiation, better move away initially until you find some hazmat suit parts. Use anti-radiation chems. The radiation resistance chem, when using above it's time limit, it will increase the radiation resistance a little bit. Can be harvested from mutant bunnies.
 - (NDC)Poison: slowly kills you, use anti-poison prepared from from snakes and spiders' poison.
 - (NDC)BloodLoss: if you lose too much blood you will eventually die. You can harvest your own blood using medical blood bags. Use blood bags to restore your lost blood. For now every blood bag is O-.
 - HitpointBlockage by chem usage: after you use chems to increase any power in any way, you have to wait or use healing, healthy or feeding items to recover. Obs.: The related HUD info may take some time to update.
 - Rain blurs vision: while it is raining your vision may randomly blur.

+Bestiary
 MutantBunny: A heavly mutated bunny with psyonic powers. It wont hunt you. It will damage you from far away and run away. It is also your main source of anti-radiation chemicals tho.
 MutantZombie: Apparenly it seems to think like a bunny now, but this one will hunt you.
 Spiders and snakes: they will poison you and are also your source of poison to make anti-poison and use in arrows.
 Radiactive zombies: they will regenerate all nearby zombies, so kill them first! they also will harm you from far away adding radiation to your body.
 WightZombies: they are the fastest runners, watch out!
 Obs.: in general, these monsters are more prone to thrive in pine forest biome.

+Generic equipment careful usage
 Be sure to carefully charge the battery to not get shocked.
 A makeshift wrench will help but keep it repaired or it may break!
 If something appears to not be working, make it sure they are in good repair condition and if they require energy do recharge batteries and fill up fuel.
 
+ETC
 Traders: Now they are common but strong survivors doing well, and they are not willing to sell anything. If you want anything from them you will have to perform their difficult tasks. But they will still buy anything from you.
 WorkStations: Take your time to gather resources to fix destroyed work stations, so when you find them it will help a lot.
 AirDrops: Mark a probability line from where you are to where the airdrop landed so you won't need to rush for it.
 World: This world is meant to be played w/o building a fortress, so keep exploring!
 DiveSwimSpeed: You can dive swim much faster now, as fast as you think it should be.
 Torch: It requires fuel to stay lit. When you attack with it and set a mob on fire, it consumes a lot of fuel. You can use gas or fat as fuel. fuel mods can be converted into an item that when used increase the combustible fuel limit a bit.
 MapMarkes: Always create map markers with useful info, be careful to avoid confusing descriptions.

+T3CHN0T35/WORKAROUNDS
 If you use some item and nothing happens (like rad resist chem or fast swimming), try crafting and using this item GSKWorkAroundFixBuffs to force related buff to kick in initially. Such problem may not happen again after that.
 After joining a game, always adjust the inventory 'Lock first N slots' otherwise as soon you click sort you lose all work you put on organizing items!
 If you think new helpful tips could be added, or better explained, drop a comment so I can review it.
 I dont know if I missed something, these tips were created after I coded it all. If you think a new tip should be added, tell me, thx!
 If you are a mod developer, the bash scripts may be useful for you too, but you need Cygwin or Linux to run them.
 The main mod can be still split into several independent mini mods. I may do that someday.
 (*1) On single player, you can hit ESC to let the world be generated while you are falling from the sky, so it may lag less.
 (*2) While falling from the sky, the slow fall trick will unintentionally keep closing your inventory or map, so you wont be able to use them properly.
 (*3) While falling from the sky, looking upwards and tracking thru the map may lag less.

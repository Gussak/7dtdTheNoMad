  <!-- HELPGOOD:VERY_HARD_START: SNOW biome has enough wood and food nearby and no radiation, but w/o proper clothes you will need to stay most of the time near a fire, may be a good challenge too, but very difficult to explore initially. You can't just run, you need to stop many times to place a bed, a campfire and lit it right away, create 2block tall structures and reinforce them to escape from zombies, and be sure your hired npc is nearby! If you die, your dropped backpack may roll far away unreachable below the freezing sea water, so be careful to not fight near the sea!!! -->

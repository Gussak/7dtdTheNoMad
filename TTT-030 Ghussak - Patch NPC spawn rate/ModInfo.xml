    <Name value="Ghussak - Patch lower NPC spawn rate"/>
    <Description value="       On my machine, the 2.5MB xml modlet alone takes 30s to load. (TODO?: test mix identical values into a single xml conditional with 'or' comparisons. Or try to patch the original MOD files, from the NPC Core and the other modlets that depend on it, but this may be a huge lot more work to implement...)              It comes with a few presets, but if you prefer to recreate the modlet you need to:       1)disable this mod       2)run the game w/o this mod       3)run on linux/cygwin (may take several minutes to prepare!):           ./fixNPCsSpawnRateCreateModlet_MultiThread.sh '/...fullPathToYourLastSavegame.../ConfigsDump/entitygroups.xml'         or            nDiv=30 ./fixNPCsSpawnRateCreateModlet_MultiThread.sh '/...fullPathToYourLastSavegame.../ConfigsDump/entitygroups.xml'         nDiv is optional. the bigger the value, less often NPCs will show up relatively to vanilla, where 1 would be vanilla values (so would be pointless to use 1)       Obs.: If there was a way to let xml calculate it internally, this patcher would be unnecessary.

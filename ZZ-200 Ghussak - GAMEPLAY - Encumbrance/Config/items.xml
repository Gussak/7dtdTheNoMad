  <!-- HELPGOOD: vanilla CarryCapacity 27 is 3 full lines of 9 slots, 60% of inv max of 9x5 = 45 total. Leaving 2 full lines to encumber.
	Vanilla outfit is max +10 slots, that is a whole line +1 slot, so it unencumbers about 1 whole line that is 20% of total.
	20% of total in 200 slots is 40 slots. To reach 100% just add 2 best pocket mods. Or almost if rise packmule skill 2 times.

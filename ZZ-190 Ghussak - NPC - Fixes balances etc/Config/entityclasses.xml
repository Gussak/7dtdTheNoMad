TODO: The ideal would be if    we equip a torch or hit it once with piercing (bullets or knife etc)    or its HP drops below 75%,    the magpie drops to ground and starts running.    if it would just flee, should be slowed to 1/3 of it's speed if it is hurt, or twice speed from fire, then the HP could remain at 100 that is near a radiated vulture.">30</set>

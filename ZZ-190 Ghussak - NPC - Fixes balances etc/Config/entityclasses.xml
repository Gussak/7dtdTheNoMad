TODO: The ideal would be if    we equip a torch it flees flying,   or hit it once with piercing (bullets or knife etc) it flees,   or its HP drops below 75% it flees,    the magpie drops to ground and starts running fleeing.    if it would just flee flying, should be slowed to 1/3 of it's speed if it is hurt so we can capture/harvest it, or twice speed if scared of fire, then the HP could remain at 100 that is near a radiated vulture.">20</set>

		This mod is a dependency of most other mini mods.
		The version is: gameEngineVersion.ModVersion (the last gameVersion the mod was tested with), but is causing warnings; TODO: suggest we could have two instead of just Version: CompatibleGameVersion and ModVersion
	DEV SELF NOTES:
		All content used by many mods shall be carefully placed here.
		All generic art shall be here.
		All displayed info that just reads cvars shall be here too, to make it easier. Tho non installed mods will prevent related values from being updated of course.
		TODO: but... may be some things could be appended using the xml modlet features? tho doing that with the UI is not that simple right?

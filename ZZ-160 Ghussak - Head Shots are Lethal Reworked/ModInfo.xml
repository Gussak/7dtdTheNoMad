    <Name value="Ghussak - Head Shots are Lethal"/>
    <Description value="       HeadShotsAreLethal reworked mod.       This was rethought to consider helmets' strengths, preventing instant lethality for them.       The damage now may have a small delay to happen.              TODO: This is WIP. increase the abrangency of bullets and melee weapons that do more or less damage based on the visible 3D model helmet (or cranium thickness like on bears). Piercing power: BulletBall - Pistol=0, SMG=0, M60=1(7.62mm mass), Riffle=2(7.62mm mass + long barrel); AP - Pistol=3, SMG=5, M60=7, Riffle=9. BoneKnife=1, spikedClub=2(spikes are short), huntingKnife=3, machete=6 (despite shown as slash, can also pierce), steelSledgeHammer=10(No Piercing But Just Smash It All, Equivalent Final Result); Helmets: none=0(clothHelmet, hats), weak=2 (bikerHelmet, workerHelmet, plastic, direworlf, lion, fireFighterHelmet, footBallHelmet, miningHelmet), medium=4(bear, scrapIronHelmet), high=6(ironHelmet), strong=9 (army, kevlar, steelBomberZomb, mechs, steelHelmet), but this is actually just for zombies based on their 3D model, as we cant equip visible helmets on them (right?). One shot kill is only if power &gt;= defense. W/o the armor piercing buff, normal/vanilla damage will be applied. add 25% chance to the shot miss a critical spot causing only minor damage?     "/>

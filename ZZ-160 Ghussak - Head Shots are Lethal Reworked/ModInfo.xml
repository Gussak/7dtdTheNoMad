    <Name value="Ghussak - Head Shots are Lethal"/>
    <Description value="       This is a rework of my original HeadShotsAreLethal mod.       This was rethought to consider helmets' strengths, preventing lethality.       The damage now may have a small delay to happen.       This is WIP: TODO: increase the abrangency of bullets and melee weapons that do more or less damage based on the visible 3D model helmet (or cranium thickness like on bears).     "/>

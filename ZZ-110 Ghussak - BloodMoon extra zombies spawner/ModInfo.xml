    <Description value=" WIP: migrating from tweaks mod     use this if you think you should see all zombies from the beggining          Zombie Crowd: This will also spawn a lot of extra weak zombies after any stonger zombie dies (TODO: split this into another minimod?). This way you will have a reason to flee instead of unnecessarily clean the area.       "/>

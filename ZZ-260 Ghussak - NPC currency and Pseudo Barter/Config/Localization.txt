dkGSKCurrencyNPC,"The new world currency has changed.\nMost of the trading, in an apocalypse, should happen as items exchange (one item by another item) and not require to use an intermediary currency item like the coins, but all exchange happen thru coins is easier.\nSo this new currency is meant to prevent having access to easy brass, and also to let item's exchange happen indirecly.\nIt also copes with hiring NPCs."

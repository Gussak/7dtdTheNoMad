	Repair and upgrade/downgrade guns anywhere.
	TODO: another way would be to keep the repair kit as repair tool and then each repair action could lower the maximum durability by 10% or 25% or 33% optional, then lower one quality level when on the last ..%
	ISSUE: be careful! the first related gun found by the engine in the inventory, will be used to craft the repair/upgrade, so better place it at slot 1 (top left)

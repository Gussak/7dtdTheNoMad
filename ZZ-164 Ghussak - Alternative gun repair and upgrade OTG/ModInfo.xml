	This actually just will require that you dismantle and reassemble the whole gun, by removing the repair tool from them etc.
	This let you have gun drops from NPCs etc, but can't use them for too long.
	This is a temporary workaround mod.
	TODO: The ideal would be that each repair action lower the maximum durability by 10% or 25% or 33%..., then lower one quality level when on the last ..%

    <Name value="Ghussak - NV Lights and Torches Reworked"/>
    <Description value="    They all require energy or fuel now.    NV and flashlights will blink if not repaired and when you get hit, and will stay most of the time off if energy ended.    Torch requires fuel or will go off too. Hitting a torch in a foe will spend fuel. Torches will probably douse in heavy rain.     "/>

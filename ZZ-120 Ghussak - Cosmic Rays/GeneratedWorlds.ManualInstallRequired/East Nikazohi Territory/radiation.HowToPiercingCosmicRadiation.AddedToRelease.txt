It may be very slow to do, so strictly follow the steps below and have pacience!

- Install Krita (has on linux too) and open radiation.png on it.
 - Right click on the single layer: SplitAlpha/AlphaIntoMask
- HIDE the transparency layer by clicking on it's eye gently.
 - Select the background layer (that has the red border)
- Click on the contiguous selection tool (wand)
 - Click on the black middle color of it (this will limit the RandomNoise region)
  - Menu: Filter/Other/RandomNoise: select Level 1 (just a bit of noise is more than enough)
 - Click on the black color of it
  - Menu: Select/Invert
   - Menu: Edit/FillWithForegroundColor (be sure the foreground color is the same of the red border)
- SHOW the transparency layer by clicking on it's eye gently.
 - Right click on the transparency layer: SplitAlpha/WriteAsAlpha
- Menu: File/Save: Click OK (change just compression to max)

Check on the game if the Cosmic Radiation spots are visible on the Radiation layer on developer mode (dm on console).

Obs.: these steps will probably work with other 7dtd PNGs but I have not tested it.

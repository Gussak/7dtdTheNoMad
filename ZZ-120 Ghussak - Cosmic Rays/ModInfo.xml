    <Description value="     'The ozone layer is pierced by unhindered invisible cosmic rays,      and the whole world is like a mine field for them,      imagine that they can even damage your DNA,      but in blood moons they are more... much more like a bless!'       - at least that was what the wanna be poet said..          Obs.: This mod only works if you install the radiation.png file in your world.       "/>

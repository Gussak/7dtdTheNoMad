dkGSKCFGElctrnTeleportToBiome,"This is to configure a biome for the teleport to sky random spawn point device.\n[PRIMARY] action changes biome id\n 1=Snow(hard with puffer coat, otherwise veryhard)\n 3=PineForest(hard, but veryhard if you are unable to take a bath)\n 5=Desert(hard, but veryhard if you run out of water)\n 8=Wasteland(hard with hazmat suit, otherwise veryhard or impossible to survive too long)\n 9=BurntForest(like the desert but just veryhard)\n Current chosen biome(CFGv1): {cvar(iGSKTeleportedToSpawnPointBiomeId:0)}"
dkGSKElctrnTeleportToBiomeFreeAndSafeCall,"(level 1 only) This is a free harmless teleport you can use once per resurrect to experiment other biome's difficulty.\nThis item cannot be crafted! Disable NPC followers warparty(patrol) mode before using it!\n[PRIMARY] action changes biome id\n 1=Snow(hard with puffer coat, otherwise veryhard)\n 3=PineForest(hard, but veryhard if you are unable to take a bath)\n 5=Desert(hard, but veryhard if you run out of water)\n 8=Wasteland(hard with hazmat suit, otherwise veryhard or impossible to survive too long)\n 9=BurntForest(like the desert but just veryhard)\n Current chosen biome(CFGv1): {cvar(iGSKTeleportedToSpawnPointBiomeId:0)}\n[SECONDARY] action will place you in a random spawn point at the chosen biome.\nObs.: This may also be used to stay in the same biome but try a better random spawn placement."
dkGSKElctrnTeleportUndergroundFreeAndSafeCall,"(level 1 only) Use this now: 1)If you are new to TheNoMad world; 2)If you are not in Desert Biome; 3)If taking too much rads dmg\n[[PRIMARY]] places you in safe underground below random spawnpoint (sends to spawnpoint and {cvar(iGSKTTUnderFreeDelay:0)}s after sent below)\n[SECONDARY:Standing] Configures how far below you will be teleported. \n[SECONDARY:Crouched] places you {cvar(.iGSKTeleUndDist:0)} below where you are (must be 60+ elevation).\nAfter teleport you can take your time to read anything you want and prepare calmly before finally teleporting to the overworld into some biome with the other free activator.\nObs.: being teleported to an area that will still be generated may lag a lot, so be patient while the game engine prepares it.\nPS.: you will be in god mode for a few seconds after using this. You will receive this item only once and it cannot be crafted! This is meant only for the first time you join The NoMad world, to give time to read understand the new things of it (allowing more would let you tele underground just before bloodmoons making it too easy to survive, but you can keep this one for your first blood moon if you have not found a good fortress yet or if you do not need it on the first day). Also, any couriers that bring your stuff will spawn down there near you and won't help you a bit when you leave usint the biome teleporter."

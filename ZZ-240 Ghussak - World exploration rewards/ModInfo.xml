    <Name value="Ghussak - World exploration rewards"/>
    <Description value="    Every POI will have a Tower of Trials (or a chimney if underground).    These special buildings have reward credits that can be harvested, but on doing so they may explode if you are not structurally careful.    The reward credits can be used to call a courier that will bring whatever you want, anywhere at any time (least during blood moons).    The exploration rewards can also help you improve your stats, so the more you explore the stronger you can become.     "/>

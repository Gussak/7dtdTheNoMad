DEPENDENCIES(suggested):
SELFNOTE: auto generated file, do not edit!
Below is the sha1sum of the dependencies I used.
Before each file is the pathname I used that also grants it's load order, so better you use the same if possible.
Missing packages will still show their folder names what helps on searching for them for now sorry.
Dependencies are not exactly 'necessary'. If you do not install them, the game may still work...

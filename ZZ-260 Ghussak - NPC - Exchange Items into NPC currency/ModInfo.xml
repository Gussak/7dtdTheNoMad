    <Name value="Ghussak - Exchange Items into NPC currency"/>
    <Description value="    A simple placeable trading block to exchange any items into a currency that hireable NPCs accept.\n    This also changes the world currency to become a workaround that lets pseudo item's exchange happen: instead of exchanging everything thru a currency coin, it works like exchanging one specific item amount by another amount or group of items (like the currency would be a virtual value and the exchange happens after the trader agrees with it, and only item for another item).\n     "/>

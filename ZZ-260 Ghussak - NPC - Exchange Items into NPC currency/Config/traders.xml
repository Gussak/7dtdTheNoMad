	changing this globally will prevent acquiring brass from traders, breaking the lore "new world currency"
	but is an OK workaround if the point is to not deal too much with traders and not expect them to have so much coins
	as most of the trading, in an apocalipse, should happen as items exchange (one item by another item) and not by using some intermediary currency item like the coins

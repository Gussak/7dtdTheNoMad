    <Name value="Ghussak - Almost No Trading Scavenge Only"/>
    <Description value="     Traders will mainly just buy now, they have just a few items and take a very long time to update their inventory.     The idea is to make the player not prefer building their home near a trader, and to find new items by luck while exploring the world.     Traders are mainly good for radiant quests now.     Vending machines wont be refilled as who did that is a zombie now.       "/>

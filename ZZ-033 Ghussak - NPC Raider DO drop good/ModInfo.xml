  <Description value="   With: WMMGameOptions:CustomItemsDegradeOnRepair, now you can at most repair the gun, that will degrade quality.   So, NPCs will probably always drop some gun, that you can use but not for too long, in initial levels. You will end up having to scrap it, and at most can create a lower grade related item type.  "/>

    <Description value="    This is a dynamically prepared mod content, it WILL NOT WORK without running the script: useDumpedXmls.sh    Put as last mod to be loaded!!! mandatory! wont work otherwise! (unless you know what you are doing).        Configure on the script the dumped cfg for slow processings like entitygroups.xml from NPC spawn rate modlet.        OBS.: This file only makes sense if the other mod's entitygroups.xml are all disabled! (at least the slow ones), the script does that.       "/>
